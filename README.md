## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing movie reviews to determine their sentiment (positive or negative). The analysis is performed using Python with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and NLTK for text processing and visualization. The dataset used is the IMDB movie reviews dataset.
## Projects
### Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
- Built a machine learning model to classify Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
- Used NLP techniques and Logistic Regression
- Achieved [accuracy score] accuracy
## Project Structure
- **Notebook**: `movie_review.ipynb` contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, and initial analysis.
- **Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from `IMDB Dataset.csv`, which includes movie reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
- **Data Cleaning**: Reviews are cleaned by removing stopwords using NLTK's stopwords corpus.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Basic exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and content.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib is used to visualize the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

## Data Preprocessing
- **Stopword Removal**: Common English stopwords (e.g., "the", "and", "is") are removed from the reviews to focus on meaningful words.
- **Text Cleaning**: The `clean_review` function processes each review to remove stopwords and prepare the text for analysis.

## Visualization
The notebook includes visualizations to explore the distribution of sentiments in the dataset. For example:
- A bar plot showing the count of positive and negative reviews.

## Future Work
- Implement sentiment analysis using machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, Naive Bayes).
- Enhance text preprocessing with techniques like stemming/lemmatization.
- Expand the dataset for more robust analysis.
